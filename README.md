</div>

This is a minimal starting point for new Netlify Create projects. It is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and [MUI](https://mui.com/), and is equipped with visual editing capabilities using Stackbit. It uses markdown files as the content source. See below for [other Netlify Create example projects](#other-stackbit-projects).

**âš¡ Demo:** [stackbit-ts-mui-nextjs-starter.netlify.app](https://stackbit-ts-mui-nextjs-starter.netlify.app/)


## Features of this branch2

This is meant to be a simple starting point that demonstrates the use of bringing your own component library, such as MUI.

In addition to MUI support, this project contains the following:

- **Flexible Pages:** Simple and flexible page model that lets editors add new pages.
- **Basic Components:** A few basic components to add to new pages.
- **Layout Elements:** Header and footer elements automatically added to pages.
- **Component & Template Presets:** Predefined arrangements of content and components for faster editing. [Learn more](https://docs.stackbit.com/conceptual-guides/content-presets/).
- **TypeScript Support:** Components and content are type-safe. (See `types` directory for definitions.)

## Getting Started

The typical development process is to begin by working locally.

Create local Stackbit project from this repo:

```txt
npx create-stackbit-app@latest --starter ts-nextjs
```

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
cd my-stackbit-site
npm run dev
```

Install the Stackbit CLI. Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Stackbit Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Stackbit URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Stackbit's visual editor for your new project.
